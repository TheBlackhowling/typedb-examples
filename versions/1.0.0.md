**Pull Request:** [#14](https://github.com/Blackhowling-Dev/NewRepoTemplate/pull/14)


## Fixed
- Remove test text from README
- Remove trailing garbage text at end of file
- Restore proper README formatting

## Changed
- Update changelog system documentation to reflect PR-based extraction (removed references to unreleased.md)
- Add setup instructions for REPO_ACCESS_TOKEN secret
- Update workflow documentation to match current implementation

The README had test text incorrectly added and trailing garbage text at the end. Also updated outdated information about the changelog system to reflect that we now extract changelog content from PR descriptions instead of unreleased.md.
